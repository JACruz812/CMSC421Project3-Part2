This is a readme for Tony Cruz's CMSC421 Project 2 Test Drivers
	For testing i followed the recommended process on the project description by manipulating the project3 part1 test into a rendition for part2. I decided to create two separate thread tests and 1 read test. I combined all of these into one main python driver to active all the others.


The make file works as so....
run [make] command in current dir, openTest & readWriteTest dirs
run [python3 test.py] in proj3test dir to run all tests back to back

Thank you for grading my project, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
